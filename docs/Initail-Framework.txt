I would like to design the framework for a new hobby-based project focused on auctioning cards. The goal is to build an isolated application hosted entirely within my Synology NAS environment, using only native Synology applications and services wherever possible.
The application must allow me to upload auction site statements (such as earnings CSV files) that include detailed transactional data. This data should capture:
•	Item-level sales details
•	Amount paid
•	Date of transaction
•	Fees and costs
•	Any additional auction-related attributes
The system must ingest and normalize this data for storage, reporting, and analysis.
________________________________________
Application Structure
The application should use a left-side tabbed navigation layout with three primary sections:
1.	Dashboard
o	High-level summary of uploaded statements
o	Aggregated earnings, fees, totals, and trends
o	Date-range filtering (required)
2.	Item-Level Cost & Sales Entry
o	Ability to input or adjust cost basis by individual sales item
o	Line-item visibility per auction record
o	Sorting and filtering across all major attributes
o	Always include date filtering
3.	General Maintenance
o	Data corrections
o	Status management
o	System-level administration functions
________________________________________
Database Requirements
•	Use the native SQL database available on the Synology NAS.
•	The database must be isolated specifically for this application.
•	All tables must follow a strict naming convention:
CG_<TablePurpose>
Examples:
o	CG_Auctions
o	CG_AuctionLineItems
o	CG_EarningsStatements
o	CG_ItemCosts
o	CG_StatusTypes
Consistency in naming is mandatory.
________________________________________
Data & Timestamp Requirements
•	All timestamps must be stored in a way that provides traceability.
•	The system must standardize all times to Central Standard Time (CST).
•	Any date fields ingested as text must be normalized into a proper SQL date format to allow:
o	Sorting
o	Filtering
o	Calculations
Date filtering is paramount and must be available across all major views.
________________________________________
Status Tracking & Traceability
Each auction line item must support detailed status tracking, including (but not limited to):
•	Completed
•	Cancelled
•	Refused
•	Did Not Pay
•	Returned
•	Any other applicable auction-related status
All statuses must:
•	Be sortable
•	Be filterable
•	Maintain historical traceability
________________________________________
CSV Upload Requirements
The system must allow uploading of an earnings CSV file covering a specific weekly time frame.
•	The CSV file name will include date information in the title.
•	The last portion of the filename will always follow the rule: earnings.csv.
•	The filename should be parsed to extract the relevant date information.
•	The CSV will contain extensive transactional data.
I will provide a sample earnings CSV file to define the structure for ingestion and normalization.
________________________________________
We need a table for inputting Payout amounts that is sortable and filterable
Fields:  Amount, Destination, Date Initiated, Arrival Date, Status (In Progress, Failed, Completed)
We also need a CSV upload for this table as well
The dates will need to be normalized from TEXT version.

________________________________________

Overall, the goal is to create a structured, traceable, sortable, and filterable auction tracking system hosted entirely within the Synology NAS ecosystem, using native SQL and consistent data governance practices throughout.
We need to keep Security in mind.  We need to have passwords to access and use the site.
