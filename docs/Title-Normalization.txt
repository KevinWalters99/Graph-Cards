Project Update: Upload Process & Data Normalization
1. Button Relocation
Please move the "Upload Earnings" button. It should be removed from the Dashboard and relocated to the Items and Cost tab.

2. Post-Import Normalization Logic
Currently, the "Upload Earnings" button performs a standard import. I would like to update this process so that once the import completes, the system automatically runs a normalization script on the titles (for both standard items and giveaways).

3. Title Padding Requirements
Almost all titles include a number sign (#) followed by a value. To ensure the titles sort correctly, we need to pad these values with leading zeros to the thousands place.

3-digit values: Add one leading zero (e.g., #134 becomes #0134).

2-digit values: Add two leading zeros (e.g., #13 becomes #0013).

1-digit values: Add three leading zeros (e.g., #1 becomes #0001).

Goal: This change will allow the system to sort titles numerically and alphabetically in the correct order.
