Dashboard UI & Logic Updates
1. Scorecard Redesign & Organization
Resize & Grouping: Reduce the overall size of the scorecards to save screen real estate. Group them by their primary metric:

Left Side: All "Count-based" scorecards.  Apply the distinct color-coding scheme

Right Side: All "Dollar-based" scorecards.  Apply the distinct color-coding scheme

Top Buyers (Item Count): * Apply the distinct color-coding scheme

Ensure both the total item count and the buyer's ID/number are visible.

Top Buyers (Dollar Amount): * Create a new set of three scorecards following the same theme as the "Item Count" cards, but focusing on total spend.

Apply the distinct color-coding scheme

Include the item count as a secondary metric on these cards.

2. "Earnings by Livestream" Table Enhancements
Sorting: Enable multi-column sorting for the table so users can organize data as needed.

Table Metadata: Add a "Record Count" indicator to show the total number of entries currently in the table.
