I need to create a Financial Summary tab with the following structure and rules:

1. Summary Overview Section make this a tab within the Financial Summary page

This tab should include a high-level summary page that provides annual totals for every column containing numeric values.

Only include records with statuses such as Completed, Accepted, Pending, or other positive/active statuses.

Exclude any records marked as Canceled, Negative Impact, or similar non-active statuses from all calculations.

Do not count canceled or negative-impact auctions in totals or auction counts.

All summaries should strictly reflect valid, active transactions.

2. Yearly Summary Table

Create one table that shows totals grouped by Year.
This should summarize all applicable numeric columns based on the filtering rules above.

3. Year-by-Quarter Summary Table

Create a second table grouped by Year and Quarter:

Q1: January–March

Q2: April–June

Q3: July–September

Q4: October–December

This will allow tracking performance both at a high-level annual view and at a more detailed quarterly level.

Additional Tab: General Costs

Create a separate tab titled General Costs make this a tab within the Financial Summary page with a table that includes the following input fields:

Date
Description
Amount
Quantity
Total (Quantity × Amount) — auto-calculated
Distribution Checkbox — determines whether the cost:
Is distributed across units within the selected time frame, or

Is applied as a lump-sum add-on for the selected period.

I will revisit this financial summary structure later to expand it further, but this establishes the foundational reporting and cost-tracking framework.
